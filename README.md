# Earthquake_&_Landslide_Detection_With_Arduino
Integrated Earthquake and Landslide Monitoring Over Wireless Sensor Network.

Sensors Used are
1) Flex sensors are used to measure the amount of deflection or bending.
2) Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor.
3) Accelerometer(ADXL335)

Using NodeMCU the data collected by the sensors are send to firebase which then can be linked to HTML view using JavaScript API.
